# Project Repository

Welcome to my project repository! This repository contains three major projects:

1. **Student Data Analysis**
2. **MNIST Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning (ResNet50)**
3. **Twitter Dataset Analysis using Multinomial Naive Bayes**

## Projects Overview

### 1. Student Data Analysis
This project involves the analysis of student data to extract meaningful insights. The key objectives are:
- Understanding student population
- Analyzing academic performance trends
- Identifying factors that influence student success

#### Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of data trends
- Modeling using Regression (Ridge and RandomForestRegressor) and Classification (RandomForestClassifier)

### 2. MNIST Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning (ResNet50)
In this project, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is used to train a classification model. The approach involves:
- Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch
- Leveraging Transfer Learning with the ResNet50 architecture to improve performance

#### Key Features:
- Model architecture using CNN
- Implementation of Transfer Learning with ResNet50
- Performance evaluation and comparison

### 3. Twitter Dataset Analysis using Multinomial Naive Bayes
This project focuses on the analysis of a Twitter dataset to classify tweets. The classification model used is the Multinomial Naive Bayes. The main tasks include:
- Preprocessing of tweet text data
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Building and evaluating the Multinomial Naive Bayes model

#### Key Features:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, punctuation removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction with TF-IDF
- Classification model implementation and evaluation
